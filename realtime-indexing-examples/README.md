# Crownpeak Search G2 Realtime Indexing Best Practice Examples

CrownPeak Search's Realtime Indexing enhances the existing search platform by providing a direct connection between the CrownPeak CMS & CrownPeak Search. With this enhancement, customers & partners can build Assets within the CrownPeak CMS for delivery directly to CrownPeak Search upon publication.

A number of use-cases where Realtime Indexing would prove advantageous:

* Time-critical publications where website crawling is too infrequent for CrownPeak Search update.
* Storing and returning items that otherwise don't need pages that are published to the delivery environment (e.g. office locations when taking advantage of CrownPeak Search's geo-location capability).
* Indexing & querying protected content that cannot be deployed to the delivery environment for security reasons.
* Choosing not to use site crawling at all.

## Configuring Crownpeak Search G2 Realtime Indexing

In order to use Search G2 Realtime Indexing, the Search G2 CMS Connector must be enabled. This connector links the CMS to each Search G2 Collection that you manage. Connectors must be configured initially by Crownpeak Support. Raise a ticket, or send an email to support@crownpeak.com.

Once the Search G2 CMS Connector has been configured, you need to update your CMS Publishing Packages to select which Search G2 CMS Connector to use for deployment (see image below):

Finally, configure Search G2 CMS Realtime Indexing Templates to define which data to publish to Search G2 during the publish operation.

### Search G2 CMS Realtime Indexing CMS Templates

There are 3 Templates that you can configure in order to use Search G2 Realtime Indexing:

* search\_g2\_insert.aspx - This is fired first time an Asset is published;
* search\_g2\_update.aspx - This is fired for subsequent updates to an existing Asset;
* search\_g2\_delete.aspx - This is fired for delete request for an existing Asset.

Example of a Search G2 CMS Realtime Indexing Insert / Update Template:

```
//set-up the CrownPeak.CMSAPI.Services.SearchG2JsonParams object for document insert/update to CrownPeak Search
var doc = new SearchG2JsonParams
{
    /*Id = asset.BranchId.ToString(), //note that this is not required if the value asset.BranchId.ToString() is to be used as the document identifier in CrownPeak Search*/
    Operation = SearchG2JsonParams.OperationType.Create, //or SearchG2JsonParams.OperationType.Update
    Overwrite = true //if a document exists with this Id, overwrite it
};
 
doc.Add("custom_s_language", "language"); //custom string field "language", takes value from asset["language"]
doc.Add("custom_s_country", "country");
doc.Add("custom_s_product", "product");
doc.Add("title", "title");
doc.Add("content", "content");
doc.Add("type", "type");
doc.AddFixed("contentLength", asset.Raw["content"].Length.ToString()); //standard CrownPeak Search field "contentLength", taking value from asset.Raw["content"].Length.ToString()
doc.AddFixed("tstamp", DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("O")); //standard CrownPeak Search field "stamp", taking value from DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("O")
doc.Add("date", AssetPropertyNames.ModifiedDate);
doc.Add("lastModified", AssetPropertyNames.ModifiedDate);
 
//add the SearchG2JsonParams document to context.JsonParams collection for insert/update to CrownPeak Search.
context.JsonParams.Add(doc);
```

Example of a Search G2 CMS Realtime Indexing Delete Template:

```
//set-up the CrownPeak.CMSAPI.Services.SearchG2JsonParams object for document delete from CrownPeak Search
var doc = new SearchG2JsonParams
{
    /*Id = asset.BranchId.ToString(), //note that this is not required if the value asset.BranchId.ToString() is to be used as the document identifier in CrownPeak Search*/
    Operation = SearchG2JsonParams.OperationType.Delete
};
 
//add the SearchG2JsonParams document to context.JsonParams collection for delete from CrownPeak Search.
context.JsonParams.Add(doc);
```

_NOTE: All string fields are limited to 32KB of data, the Crownpeak Search G2 Realtime Indexing enhancement will automatically truncate any field values to 32KB, if the value is larger._

### Logging Search G2 Realtime Indexing Actions

A record is added to the System Log under 'Custom' in the Action filter when an asset is sent for Realtime Indexing.  This log can be viewed under Reports > Audit > System (see below):

## Binary Content Enhancement

The Crownpeak Search G2 Binary Content Enhancement allows the metadata & content from a Binary Asset (e.g. PDF, Microsoft Office) to be extracted, in order for it to be passed into a Search G2 Collection during Realtime Indexing.

When a Binary Asset is uploaded to the Crownpeak CMS, the file is passed to our Content Extraction Service, which stores the returned metadata & content string against the Binary Asset. There is also a just-in-time function to synchronously extract the data during Realtime Indexing publishing, in the event of it not having been previously stored - this is useful for use-cases where this feature is retro-fitted into an application, without the need to re-upload all Binary Assets.

Assuming that are using Input.ShowAcquireDocument("Pick a document", "document‚Äù); in your input.aspx Template File, then you could use the following code to store the metadata & content from the Binary Asset within a Realtime Indexing Template file:

```
var document = Asset.Load(asset["document"]);
if (document.IsLoaded)
{
	var extractedContent = document.ExtractedContent;
	if (extractedContent != null)
	{
		doc.AddFixed("content", extractedContent.Content);

		var metadata = extractedContent.Metadata;
		if (metadata != null)
		{
			if (metadata.ContainsKey("meta:author"))
			{
				// NOTE: these values are usually strings, but can sometimes be arrays of strings
				// depending on the source document and the property
				var value = metadata["meta:author"] as string;
				if (value != null)
					doc.AddFixed("custom_s_author", value);
			}
			if (metadata.ContainsKey("meta:creation-date"))
			{
				var value = metadata["meta:creation-date"] as string;
				if (value != null)
					doc.AddFixed("custom_dt_created", value);
			}
			if (metadata.ContainsKey("Last-Modified"))
			{
				var value = metadata["Last-Modified"] as string;
				if (value != null)
					doc.AddFixed("custom_dt_modified", value);
			}
		}
	}
}
```
