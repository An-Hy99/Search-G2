# Crownpeak Search G2 Realtime Indexing Best Practice Examples

CrownPeak Search's Realtime Indexing enhances the existing search platform by providing a direct connection between the CrownPeak CMS & CrownPeak Search. With this enhancement, customers & partners can build Assets within the CrownPeak CMS for delivery directly to CrownPeak Search upon publication.

A number of use-cases where Realtime Indexing would prove advantageous:

* Time-critical publications where website crawling is too infrequent for CrownPeak Search update.
* Storing and returning items that otherwise don't need pages that are published to the delivery environment (e.g. office locations when taking advantage of CrownPeak Search's geo-location capability).
* Indexing & querying protected content that cannot be deployed to the delivery environment for security reasons.
* Choosing not to use site crawling at all.
